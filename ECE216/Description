ECE216H1 S -- Signals and Systems

II - AECPEBASC, II - AEELEBASC 3/-/2/0.50

Fundamental discrete- and continuous-time signals, definition and properties of systems, linearity and time invariance, convolution, impulse response, differential and difference equations, Fourier analysis, sampling and aliasing, applications in communications.

 

Learning Objectives:

What is a “system”?
– Time- and frequency-domain representation and analysis of linear time-invariant (LTI) systems

What is “frequency”?
– Fourier series presentation of continuous-time periodic signals. Fourier transform of continuous-time arbitrary signals.

What is a “filter”?
– Fourier transform presentation of continuous-time LTI systems

How to convert a continuous-time signal into discrete time?
– Sampling theorem

What is “frequency” in discrete-time?
– Discrete-time system and its Fourier analysis

What is the practical relevance of this course?
– Applications to communication systems
