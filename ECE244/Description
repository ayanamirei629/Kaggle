n this course provides a foundation in programming using an object-oriented programming language: C++. Topics include classes and objects, inheritance, exception handling, basic data structures (lists, tree, etc.), Big-O complexity analysis, and testing and debugging. The laboratory assignments emphasize the use of object-oriented programming constructs in the design and implementation of reasonably large programs.
